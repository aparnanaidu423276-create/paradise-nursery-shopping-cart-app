# Paradise Nursery Shopping Cart Application

Paradise Nursery is a modern, user-friendly online plant shopping application built using **React** and **Redux Toolkit**. The application allows users to browse a wide variety of houseplants, view plant details such as images, names, categories, and prices, and add selected plants to a shopping cart.

Users can manage their shopping cart by increasing or decreasing item quantities, removing items, and viewing the total cost dynamically. The application also features a responsive navigation bar for smooth navigation between the Home, Products, and Cart pages.

This project demonstrates the implementation of component-based architecture, state management using Redux, and dynamic UI updates in a real-world e-commerce scenario.
